## Reflection

This was a 3 day project build to show skills in Node and React. The task was to create a React frontend application with Node js backend to
allow the users to add, view, update their books. All data about the books is stored in MongoDB database. Users should have possibility to add new books with parameters such as book name, author and description. Users should be able to see all of their books in list and be able to edit the book's details if need be.
